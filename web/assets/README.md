# Assets directory

This directory is where Leafcutter keeps compiled versions of linked asset files like images, scripts, and stylesheets. Generally you shouldn't have to think about it, and shouldn't edit things in here directly. If you'd like to free up disk space, you can delete the contents, but make sure to also clear your cache, and if you're using the static pages addon some pages might break until they get rebuilt.

This directory should be writeable by PHP, and publicly accessible on the web.
